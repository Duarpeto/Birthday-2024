Developer Environment
----------
Project is being developed in Godot 4.2

You can download that here: https://godotengine.org/download/windows/
Get the 64-bit 4.2.X standard edition. NOT the .NET version

Godot is just an .exe and does not require any installation
Run the .exe (either one. Console just opens a cmd window that is redundant with the console Output)
Select import, navigate to the project folder and import

Godot is already equipped with a script editor (selectable at the top)
But you can setup an IDE if you want: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/contributing/development/configuring_an_ide/index.html
